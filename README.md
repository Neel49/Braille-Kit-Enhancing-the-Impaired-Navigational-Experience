# Braille-Kit-Enhancing-the-Impaired-Navigational-Experience

The purpose of this project is to create a solution to help a blind and deaf person achieve independence alongside safe navigation and an easier daily lifestyle.

More specifically I attempted to allieviate the communication and nagivational barrier the deaf-blind community face.
